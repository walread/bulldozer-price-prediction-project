    "# ðŸšœ Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how similar bulldozers have been sold for?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data\n",
    "\n",
    "Three main datasets: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n",
    "* Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.\n",
    "* Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The goal is to build a machine learning model which minimizes RMSLE. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle provides a data dictionary detailing all of the features of the dataset. "
